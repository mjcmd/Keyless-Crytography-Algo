# Keyless-Crytography-Algo
A NEW CRYPTOGRAPHY ALGORITHM BASED ON ASCII CODE

Abstract—Cryptography is the science of converting messages to coded messages to be recognized only by the intended receiver. It is considered as the key enabling technology for protecting distributed systems. The need to protect user’s data and infrastructures becomes more crucial than ever as the use of internet is growing very rapidly. In spite of the great number of cryptography algorithms reported in the literature, important aspects have, to date been given little attention. One of these aspects is how to link each character in the plaintext with its previous character. This paper proposes a new cryptography algorithm which considers linking each character in the plaintext with its previous one during encryption and decryption. The proposed algorithm can be used to handle different situations in cryptography applications. The simulations results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
